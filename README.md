# Brightbronze Horizons
A Fabric & NeoForge Mod for Minecraft 1.21

## Field Log: Arrival

I remember the impact—then nothing. No sky I recognize, no horizon that behaves, no familiar pull of distance. Just a village, warm lamps, wheat in the breeze… and an emptiness beyond it that swallows sound. The locals don’t seem afraid. They build where the ground is solid and stop where it isn’t.

I learned why the first time I tried to leave.

A few steps past the village boundary, the realm *fails to agree that I exist*. My body unthreads. My senses scatter. I discorporate.. and below me is an infinite, patient void.

But I’m not helpless.

I know an alloy, an old explorer’s trick for anchoring unstable places. A bright metal that hums when reality is thin: Brightbronze. If I can make it here, I can do what I was trained to do: Stabilize the frontier. Expand the map. Turn "nowhere" into "somewhere".


## Gameplay

**Brightbronze Horizons** drops you into a fragile realm: you always begin in a **plains village**, surrounded by the **void**. The village is safe. The edge is not.

Your goal is to **craft Brightbronze** and use it to create **Horizon Anchors**—special blocks that **stabilize the realm** and **spawn new chunks** when placed on the **edge** of your current world.

The rhythm of survival is simple and deliberate:

1. **Scavenge and build within the village**  
   Gather resources, set up a base, and prepare for long-term expansion.

2. **Forge Brightbronze**  
   Combine familiar metals into something meant for the unreal—then refine it into ingots and nuggets for crafting.

3. **Craft a Horizon Anchor**  
   Each anchor is a tuned stabilizer. Its "catalyst" determines what kind of land it can call forth.

4. **Place the Anchor at the frontier**  
   Put it on the **edge of the current generated area** to extend the world by **one new chunk**, pushing the boundary outward.

5. **Repeat: expand, explore, upgrade**  
   Start local. Reach the Overworld’s breadth. Push into stranger climates. Eventually, you’ll stabilize pathways into realms that should not be adjacent to a village at all.

## Recipes

### Brightbronze Progression

- `1× Copper Ingot + 2× Iron Nugget + 1× Gold Nugget` → `1× Brightbronze Amalgam`
- Smelt: `1× Brightbronze Amalgam` → `1× Brightbronze Ingot`
- `1× Brightbronze Ingot` → `9× Brightbronze Nugget`

### Horizon Anchors

Horizon Anchors are crafted using a **Brightbronze frame** around a **catalyst block**. The catalyst determines what kind of terrain the anchor can stabilize into existence.

**Anchor Frame Pattern**
- `B` = Brightbronze Ingot
- `n` = Brightbronze Nugget
- `C` = Catalyst block (varies by anchor)

```
B n B
n C n
B n B
```

__Local Horizon Anchor__  
**Catalyst:** `Block of Coal`  
**Effect:** Spawns a new chunk that **matches the biome** where the anchor is placed.

__Overworld Horizon Anchor__  
**Catalyst:** `Block of Copper`  
**Effect:** Spawns a new chunk from **common and dry Overworld biomes** (plains, forests, deserts, etc.).

__Tidal Horizon Anchor__  
**Catalyst:** `Block of Iron`  
**Effect:** Spawns a new chunk from **rare and wet Overworld biomes** (jungle, swamp, ocean, etc.).

__Infernal Horizon Anchor__  
**Catalyst:** `Block of Gold`  
**Effect:** Spawns a new chunk from **Nether biomes**.

__Astral Horizon Anchor__  
**Catalyst:** `Block of Diamond`  
**Effect:** Spawns a new chunk from **End biomes**.
